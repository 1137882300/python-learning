Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\\naccepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 29, 2023 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited\\nconsolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, as filed with the SEC,\\nbut does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring\\nadjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the\\ninterim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in\\nconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\\nended January 29, 2023. \\nSignificant Accounting Policies\\nThere have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant\\nAccounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\\nJanuary 29, 2023.\\nFiscal Year\\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 are both 52-week years. The second\\nquarters of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were both 13-week quarters.\\nReclassifications\\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All\\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going\\nbasis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts\\nreceivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other\\ncharges, property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions\\nthat we believe are reasonable.\\nIn February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and\\nusage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of our server, storage, and network equipment from three to a range of four to\\nfive years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to seven years. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning\\nof fiscal year 2024. Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net, in use\\nas of the end of fiscal year 2023, the effect of this change in estimate for the three months ended July 30, 2023 was a benefit of $5 million and\\n$28 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $33 million and net\\nincome of $27 million after tax, or $0.01 per both basic and diluted share. The effect of this change in estimate for the first half of fiscal year 2024\\nwas a benefit of $7 million and $59 million for\\n9', metadata={'source': '../../file/nvidia_10q_2023.pdf', 'page': 8})), ('2789ebb6-6611-4baf-9378-7b537e0ad4ae', Document(page_content='NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\n(Unaudited)\\ncost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $66 million and net income of\\n$55 million after tax, or $0.02 per both basic and diluted share.\\nNote 2 - Business Combination\\nTermination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\\nIn February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby\\nNVIDIA would have acquired Arm Limited, or Arm, from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate due to significant regulatory challenges\\npreventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-\\noff of the prepayment provided at signing.\\nNote 3 - Leases\\nOur lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data\\ncenter space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2024 and 2035.\\nFuture minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of July 30, 2023 are as follows:\\nOperating Lease\\nObligations\\n (In millions)\\nFiscal Year:  \\n2024 (excluding first half of fiscal year 2024) $ 134 \\n2025 249 \\n2026 227 \\n2027 211 \\n2028 191 \\n2029 and thereafter 415 \\nTotal 1,427 \\nLess imputed interest 178 \\nPresent value of net future minimum lease payments 1,249 \\nLess short-term operating lease liabilities 208 \\nLong-term operating lease liabilities $ 1,041 \\nIn addition, we have operating leases, primarily for our data centers, that are expected to commence between the third quarter of fiscal year\\n2024 and the end of fiscal year 2025 with lease terms of 3 to 8 years for $205 million.\\nOperating lease expenses were $67 million and $47 million for the second quarter of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $126 million\\nand $90 million for the first half of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The income tax as a\\npercentage of income before income tax was an expense of 11.4% and 10.4% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024,\\nrespectively, a benefit of 38.0% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, and an expense of 0.3% for the first half of fiscal year 2023.\\nThe increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income\\ndeduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax.\\nOur effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits\\nfrom the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit.\\nFor the first half of fiscal year 2024, there were no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax\\njurisdictions.

Our invention of the GPU in 1999 has sparked the growth of\\nthe PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and has fueled industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA\\nis now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.\\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements.\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\\nDemand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last two quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. In\\norder to meet this demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers and entered into prepaid\\nsupply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes and number of suppliers may create more supply chain complexity and\\nexecution risk. We expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year. We have entered and expect to continue to enter into supplier\\nand capacity arrangements.\\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners\\nprepare to ship and support new products. We are in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional\\nVisualization, and Gaming products. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners\\n25', metadata={'source': '../../file/nvidia_10q_2023.pdf', 'page': 24})), ('4a71c5f5-b6e7-427e-ae4d-d8208fc86139', Document(page_content='reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. In\\naddition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges and quality concerns not identified in manufacturing\\ntesting. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and delay further production of our architecture. While we\\nhave managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult,\\nmay impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist such as our Omniverse platform, third-\\nparty large language models, and generative AI models. We have recently begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX cloud services\\ndirectly and through our network of partners, which includes cloud-based infrastructure and software and services for training and deploying AI\\nmodels, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for customizable pretrained AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services\\ncan be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use\\ncases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand\\nfor Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown.\\nGlobal Trade\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced license requirements that, with certain exceptions,\\nimpact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or\\nboards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG informed us of an additional\\nlicensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the\\nMiddle East. We have sold alternative products in China not subject to the license requirements, such as our A800 or H800 offerings.\\nGiven the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions, if adopted, would have an\\nimmediate material impact on our financial results. However, over the long term, our results and competitive position may be harmed, and we\\nmay be effectively excluded from all or part of the China market if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls, if customers in China\\ndo not want to purchase our alternative product offerings, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own\\ninternal solution, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant\\ntransition costs.\\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific, including\\nChina, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan, new export controls or changes to existing export controls could negatively impact our business.\\nMacroeconomic Factors\\nMacroeconomic factors, including\\u2009inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global\\neconomic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations. While difficult to isolate and quantify,\\nthese macroeconomic factors can impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of\\nour investments. Our product and solution pricing strategy generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply\\nchain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.\\u2009\\u2009\\n26', metadata={'source': '../../file/nvidia_10q_2023.pdf', 'page': 25})), ('76ff5b34-664a-404f-bcab-b3f745d52c77', Document(page_content='Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Summary\\nThree Months Ended\\n July 30, 2023 April 30, 2023 July 31, 2022Quarter-over-Quarter\\nChangeYear-over-Year\\nChange\\n($ in millions, except per share data)\\nRevenue $ 13,507 $ 7,192 $ 6,704 88 % 101 %\\nGross margin 70.1 % 64.6 % 43.5 % 5.5 pts 26.6 pts\\nOperating expenses $ 2,662 $ 2,508 $ 2,416 6 % 10 %\\nOperating income $ 6,800 $ 2,140 $ 499 218 % 1,263 %\\nNet income $ 6,188 $ 2,043 $ 656 203 % 843 %\\nNet income per diluted share $ 2.48 $ 0.82 $ 0.26 202 % 854 %\\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications.

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only\\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the\\nfact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations\\nin all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within\\nNVIDIA have been detected.\\nPART II.

If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our\\nfinancial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depend on our ability to anticipate and\\nprovide features and functionality that customers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent\\nus from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will\\nprovide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmed.\\nWe have recently begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX cloud services directly and through our network of partners, which includes\\ncloud-based infrastructure and software and services for training and deploying AI models, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for customizable\\npretrained AI models. We have partnered with CSPs to host these software and services in their data centers, and we entered and may continue\\nto enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support these offerings and our research and development activities.

These new business models\\nor strategies may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or services. We may incur significant costs and\\nmay not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings.\\nFailure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\\nWe use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have had and may in the future have long manufacturing lead times.\\nWe are not provided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a\\nquarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant\\nmismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our\\nmarket platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.\\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future\\nenter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our\\nbusiness needs or our long-term demand expectations may change. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be\\nimpeded if components from third parties that are necessary for the finished product are not available. This risk may increase as a result of our\\nplatform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead\\ntimes on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums\\nand provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. We may not\\nhave the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand\\nfor our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue,\\nincluding:\\n•competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\\n•changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\\n•sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\\n•rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\\n•time to market;\\n•new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\\n•new or unexpected end use cases;\\n•increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\\n•business decisions made by third parties;\\n•the demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX cloud services;\\n•changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\\n•the demand for our products relating to cryptocurrency mining, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and\\ngenerative AI models; or\\n•government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as increased restrictions on gaming usage.\\nDemand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last two quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year.

These increased purchase volumes and\\nnumber of suppliers may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect our supply to increase each quarter through next\\nyear. We have entered and expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity arrangements. We may incur inventory provisions or\\nimpairments if our inventory or supply and capacity commitments are impacted by changes in demand for our products.\\nOur customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product\\ntransitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our\\nchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Our architecture transitions of Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming\\nproducts may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product\\ntransitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or\\nvolatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when\\ncustomers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture\\ntransitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted.\\nIn addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges and quality concerns not identified in\\nmanufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and delay further production of our\\narchitecture. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these\\ntransitions are difficult, and we may incur additional costs.\\nWe sell most of our products through channel partners, who sell to distributors, retailers, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made\\nby our channel partners, distributors, retailers, and in response to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products\\nhave impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates\\nprovided by various downstream parties.\\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to\\nincrease production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase\\nproduction levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience\\nsupply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at\\nall, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally,\\nsince some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one\\ncomponent have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our\\ncompetitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a\\nreduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a\\nresult of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our\\nproducts as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also\\nwritten-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-\\ncancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make\\nchanges to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and\\nprepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively\\nimpact our gross margins and financial results.\\nWe build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist, such as NVIDIA DGX cloud services, our\\nOmniverse platform, third-party large language models and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and\\nservices can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these\\nuse cases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased\\ndemand for Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is\\n37\", metadata={'source': '../../file/nvidia_10q_2023.pdf', 'page': 36})), ('43e81bd5-7977-439f-9a08-c24302b8052d', Document(page_content='unknown. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree\\nof precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we expect to start shipping our CPU\\nproduct offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our\\nCPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.\\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead\\ntimes may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical\\ntensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract\\nmanufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and\\ncan in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years\\nago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable\\ndegree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for\\nour products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government\\ncryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has\\nimpacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand\\nfor our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have\\nreduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased\\naftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously\\nintroduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address\\ndemand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Following the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace GPU architectures no\\nlonger include LHR. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which\\nalso makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and distribution\\nchannels.\\nAdditionally, we depend on developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications\\nthat leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as\\nGeForce NOW. Failure by developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our\\nplatforms, or failure by third-party content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our\\ncustomers or end users on our platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our\\ncontrol over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedules and\\ncould harm our business.\\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test\\nor package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These subcontractors assist with procuring components used in\\nour systems, boards, and products. We face several risks which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer\\ndemand and scale our supply chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business\\noperations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\\n•lack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from\\nincorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;\\n•failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test\\ncapacity for our products;\\n38', metadata={'source': '../../file/nvidia_10q_2023.pdf', 'page': 37})), ('cfb9b4af-8bd2-4ebd-8c84-d2931354e1a2', Document(page_content='•failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller\\ngeometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our\\nproducts;\\n•limited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and\\nmemory manufacturers;\\n•loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and\\ncommencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;\\n•lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\\n•suppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification;\\n•delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or\\nfoundries prioritize our competitors’ or other customers’ orders over ours;\\n•requirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance;\\n•low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process technology; and\\n•disruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves or other natural disasters and\\nelectricity conservation efforts.\\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business.\\nWe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally.

The global nature of our\\nbusiness subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations, including domestic and international economic and political conditions between\\ncountries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health\\nissues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, domestic and international business and cultural\\npractices that differ, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, and/or currency fluctuations, and natural disasters, acts of war or\\nother military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events.\\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages,\\ntelecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military\\nactions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our\\ncorporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located\\nin California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our\\noperations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas.\\nCatastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and\\ndevelopment systems and personnel.

For example, other countries have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where\\nwe have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our\\noperations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including\\nnatural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic,\\nbusiness, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being\\nlocated and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party\\nsystems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and\\nsubstantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future\\nsales and operating results.\\nAdditionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including\\ndue to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and\\nservices and harm our business. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service\\ninterruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on\\naccess to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the\\nability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services.\\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully\\nintegrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.\\nWe have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help\\nexpand or enhance our existing strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our\\nability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we\\npursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If\\nwe are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to\\npursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition\\nless attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our\\nbusiness. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived\\nability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold\\ninvestments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In\\naddition, we have invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key\\nbusiness initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which\\nwe invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any\\nof the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. We face\\nadditional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s\\nattention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;\\ndifficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings\\ninitiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the\\nassets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring.\\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\\n•difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees,\\nincluding key personnel, of the acquired business;\\n•assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\\n40', metadata={'source': '../../file/nvidia_10q_2023.pdf', 'page': 39})), ('34baed83-e8e3-4ec3-a3c1-3af012d68cf7', Document(page_content='•integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\\n•coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\\n•stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise\\nunable to close an acquisition;\\n•potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt\\ncovenants or other restrictions;\\n•the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\\n•the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\\n•negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\\n•exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\\n•impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.\\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges\\nincluding lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic\\ndata interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration\\npersonnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of\\nsales to end customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these end\\ncustomers.\\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. For example,\\none data center distributor customer represented approximately 17% and 13% of total revenue for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year\\n2024, respectively. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our\\noperating results depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our\\nprocessors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter\\ntheir purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally\\ncancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their\\nown solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the\\nmarkets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. A large CSP, which primarily\\npurchases indirectly through multiple system integrators and distributors, is estimated to represent approximately 22% and 19% of total revenue\\nfor the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and was attributable to our Compute & Networking segment. Our estimated\\nCompute & Networking end customer demand is concentrated among several large CSPs and consumer internet companies. Most of these\\nlarge companies do not purchase directly from us but often purchase through multiple system integrators, distributors, and channel partners. We\\nexpect this concentration trend will continue. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter\\nend, the system builders and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our\\nrevenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or\\nother countries’ trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other\\nactions may adversely impact our business.\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership\\nand infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and\\n41', metadata={'source': '../../file/nvidia_10q_2023.pdf', 'page': 40})), ('0e0fbcac-e789-4dd9-95d3-e4311b0e1cd6', Document(page_content='tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation\\nrestrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental,\\nhealth, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such\\nrequirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and\\nability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not\\nviolate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations\\ncould result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to\\nour reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could\\nlead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and\\noperate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation,\\nregulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, and enforcement activity\\nresulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations. Revisions to laws or regulations or their\\ninterpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs,\\nrestrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact\\nthe timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate\\ncould negatively impact our business and results of operations.\\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions,\\ndecrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and\\nemployees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government\\nrestricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material\\nadverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S.\\nlaws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could\\nhave a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control\\nmeasures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year\\n2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted end customer\\nsales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has already resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products\\nand services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and\\nservice offerings.\\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI\\napplications, models, and solutions, could result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, refining, and\\ndeploying large language models.

These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment, and\\ntechnology used to develop, produce, and manufacture certain chips, to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically\\nimpact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The\\nlicense requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance\\nthresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of\\nproducts, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal\\nyear 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain\\ncustomers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out\\nof China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and\\nsupply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period.\\nWe have sold alternative products in China not subject to the license requirements, such as our A800 or H800 offerings. To the extent that a\\ncustomer requires products covered by the license requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG\\nwill grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner. The requirements have a disproportionate impact\\non NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may\\nbe able to acquire licenses for their products.\\nManagement of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming.

Additionally, if we are unable to sell our alternative product offerings to affected customers, we may have excess\\ninventory, harming our results. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions\\nthat we cannot or choose not to fulfill.

Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG may unilaterally change the export\\ncontrol rules at any time and subject a wide range of our products, including but not limited to A800, H800, and gaming products to export\\nrestrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable\\nto sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the license requirements, effectively\\nexcluding us from all or part of the China market. For example, the USG has reportedly been urged to impose conditions to limit the ability of\\nforeign firms to create large-scale GPU clusters, for example by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair\\nGPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. Such restrictions would be technically and commercially infeasible, and if imposed by the\\nUSG, would effectively prevent exports of products exceeding the thresholds to impacted regions and customers. Export controls restricting our\\ngaming products, may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets\\noutside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our\\nproducts, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also\\nnegatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our\\nnetworking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier\\nmodel training. Any new control that impacts a wide range of our products, including but not limited to A800, H800, and gaming products would\\nlikely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the\\nscope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls may also encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to “design-\\nout” U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve markets\\nworldwide. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but\\nalso in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in\\nU.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export\\ncontrols restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be\\nrestricted by U.S. controls.\\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our\\nGaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese\\ngovernment may impose restrictions on the sale to certain end customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our\\npartners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government recently announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing\\ncertain products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact\\nour business and financial results.\\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new\\nrestrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our\\nbusiness and financial results.\\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving\\nshareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit\\nfrom multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel\\ninventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently\\nuncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling\\ncertain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable\\noutcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and\\ndisruptive to our operations.\\n44', metadata={'source': '../../file/nvidia_10q_2023.pdf', 'page': 43})), ('b493ab33-6a88-4195-9753-d907a87d640c', Document(page_content=\"ITEM 2.
