    "# Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the Task: Grasp the main objective, goals, requirements, constraints, and expected output.\n",
    "- Minimal Changes: If an existing prompt is provided, improve it only if it's simple. For complex prompts, enhance clarity and add missing elements without altering the original structure.\n",
    "- Reasoning Before Conclusions**: Encourage reasoning steps before any conclusions are reached. ATTENTION! If the user provides examples where the reasoning happens afterward, REVERSE the order! NEVER START EXAMPLES WITH CONCLUSIONS!\n",
    "    - Reasoning Order: Call out reasoning portions of the prompt and conclusion parts (specific fields by name). For each, determine the ORDER in which this is done, and whether it needs to be reversed.\n",
    "    - Conclusion, classifications, or results should ALWAYS appear last.\n",
    "- Examples: Include high-quality examples if helpful, using placeholders [in brackets] for complex elements.\n",
    "   - What kinds of examples may need to be included, how many, and whether they are complex enough to benefit from placeholders.\n",
    "- Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear, specific language. Avoid unnecessary instructions or bland statements.\n",
    "- Formatting: Use markdown features for readability. DO NOT USE ``` CODE BLOCKS UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED.\n",
    "- Preserve User Content: If the input task or prompt includes extensive guidelines or examples, preserve them entirely, or as closely as possible. If they are vague, consider breaking down into sub-steps. Keep any details, guidelines, examples, variables, or placeholders provided by the user.\n",
    "- Constants: DO include constants in the prompt, as they are not susceptible to prompt injection. Such as guides, rubrics, and examples.\n",
    "- Output Format: Explicitly the most appropriate output format, in detail. This should include length and syntax (e.g. short sentence, paragraph, JSON, etc.)\n",
    "    - For tasks outputting well-defined or structured data (classification, JSON, etc.) bias toward outputting a JSON.\n",
    "    - JSON should never be wrapped in code blocks (```) unless explicitly requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final prompt you output should adhere to the following structure below. Do not include any additional commentary, only output the completed system prompt. SPECIFICALLY, do not include any additional messages at the start or end of the prompt. (e.g. no \"---\")\n",

       "**Executive Summary**:  \n",
       "The company's financial performance for Q2 2024 indicates strong growth in revenue and improvements in margins, despite continuing net losses. Vehicle sales increased significantly, outperforming both the previous quarter and the same quarter last year. Margins have improved, indicating enhanced cost management or pricing strategy. Although the net loss remains, it has reduced both sequentially and year-over-year, highlighting improvements in operational efficiency but indicating ongoing challenges in reaching profitability.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Detailed Financial Analysis**:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Ratio Analysis**:\n",
       "  - **Gross Profit Margin**: Increased substantially to 9.7% from 4.9% in Q1 2024 and 1.0% in Q2 2023, a positive indicator of cost control and operational efficiency.\n",
       "  - **Net Profit Margin**: The net loss margin needs more context but represents potential for future positive turnovers if current trends continue.\n",
       "  - **Vehicle Margin**: Improved to 12.2% from 9.2% in Q1 2024 and 6.2% in Q2 2023, highlighting better cost management in vehicle production or improved pricing power.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Trend Analysis**:\n",
       "  - **Revenue Growth**: Total revenues surged by 76.1% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and 98.9% year-over-year (YoY). This is driven mainly by vehicle sales, which increased by 87.1% QoQ and 118.2% YoY, indicating robust demand and potentially successful marketing or expansion strategies.\n",
       "  - **Profitability**: While gross profit has dramatically improved, losses from operations and net loss have decreased both sequentially and from the previous year. This shows progress towards breakeven but also highlights the necessity for further improvements.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Benchmark Comparison**:\n",
       "  - Without specific industry benchmarks in this extract, the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter improvements suggest better alignment with high-growth industry counterparts, especially given the significant advances in gross and vehicle margins.\n",
       "  - The continued reduction in adjusted net losses compared to previous periods aligns well with a trend towards better operational efficiency compared to industry metrics often dominated by large losses in early growth stages.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Areas of Concern and Recommendations**:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Profitability Concerns**: Despite significant revenue growth, profitability remains a concern with continued net losses. It is crucial to explore avenues to further improve operational efficiency and cost management.\n",
       "  - **Recommendation**: Focus on continuous improvement in cost efficiencies, potentially through leveraging economies of scale or further enhancing production processes.\n",
       "  \n",
       "- **Potential for Cash Burn**: The ongoing net losses could imply significant cash outflows. Ensuring adequate liquidity and reviewing financing strategies will be essential.\n",
       "  - **Recommendation**: Re-evaluate cash flow strategy and explore cost optimization efforts to minimize continuing cash burn.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Market and Demand Fluctuations**: Sustaining such high revenue growth rates may become challenging if market conditions change.\n",
       "  - **Recommendation**: Diversify product offerings and revenue streams to mitigate reliance on vehicle sales.\n",
       "\n",
       "These insights suggest a positive trajectory but emphasize the importance of strategic financial management to continue this momentum towards operational sustainability and eventual profitability."

       "### Ronaldo's Playful Jibe: From Juventus to Barcelona\n",
       "\n",
       "Cristiano Ronaldo has made headlines once again, not for his moves on the pitch, but for a cheeky remark directed at his former Juventus teammate, Wojciech Szczesny. The two football stars reunited in Poland, where Portugal was playing, bringing a touch of humor to a conversation about Szczesny's latest career move.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Szczesny's Journey: From Retirement to Barcelona\n",
       "\n",
       "Wojciech Szczesny had announced his retirement over the summer, seemingly closing the chapter on his time at Juventus after the team decided to plan for the future without him. However, his retirement was short-lived. When Marc-Andre ter Stegen faced an unexpected absence, Barcelona called upon Szczesny as a last-minute, emergency solution. \n",
       "\n",
       "This sudden shift from the sidelines back to the field with such a prestigious club was bound to spark some humorous exchanges—especially from a player like Ronaldo, known for his charismatic and sometimes cheeky personality.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Ronaldo's Jest and Juventus Reflections\n",
       "\n",
       "During their catch-up, captured by the Polish Football Federation, Ronaldo congratulated Szczesny on his move to Barcelona but couldn't resist making a light-hearted comment: \"You needed to retire to go to a big club.\" This playful jab seemed to imply that Barcelona was a step up from their mutual former club, Juventus.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ronaldo’s tenure at Juventus was a mixture of success and scrutiny. He hailed Juve as an \"amazing club\" when leaving for Manchester United in 2021. His individual record was impressive, with 101 goals in 134 appearances and two Serie A titles to his name. Yet, debates linger over whether he truly uplifted the team's overall performance during his stay. \n",
       "\n",
       "#### A Dispute Over Unpaid Wages\n",
       "\n",
       "Adding another layer to Ronaldo's story with Juventus is the legal scuffle they faced earlier this year. Ronaldo took the club to court over unpaid wages that were deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic. The court sided with Ronaldo, ordering Juventus to pay him €10 million.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "In the world of football, where camaraderie and competition intertwine, Ronaldo's jest may simply reflect the lighthearted banter shared between two former teammates. As Szczesny embarks on his new journey with Barcelona, the football globe watches eagerly, waiting to see how these storylines continue to unfold. After all, in both football and friendship, it's these moments of humor and humanity that often capture the essence of the game."
